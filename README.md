# AIRCANVAS
Air Canvas is a computer vision application that allows users to draw in the air using hand gestures, capturing the motion and translating it into digital drawings on the screen. Air Canvas can process real-time video feeds to detect and track hand movements, creating a seamless and intuitive drawing experience.
